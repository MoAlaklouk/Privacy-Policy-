At الوقاية من الامراض المنقولة, your privacy is of utmost importance. As a developer and an Android and iOS user myself, I understand how frustrating it is when apps collect data without your knowledge. This Privacy Policy outlines how your data is managed and safeguarded while using this app.

This app does not collect any personally identifiable information.

App Data:
All data, such as app preferences (e.g., theme settings), is stored locally on your device. This data is not transmitted or stored on external servers.

Data Deletion: All app data can be erased by:
Clearing the app's data in your device settings.
Uninstalling the app from your device.
5. Security
While this app does not collect personal data, I strive to implement security best practices to prevent any inadvertent vulnerabilities. However, no method of software implementation is entirely foolproof. If you identify any security vulnerabilities, please contact me immediately.
